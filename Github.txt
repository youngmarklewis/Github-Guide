Create a 'New repository' (Repo) and make this public or private and tick the box to add a readme file. Give it a description.
Next, select 'New file' to create a new file. In this example we are using the .txt extension
Add the content in the '<> Code' body
Select 'Commit directly to the master branch' radio button
Then select 'Commit new file' (save) in other words change the file and make a commit
To edit the file select the .txt file and then the edit pencil icon
Make changes to the file, then add a summary of the changes in the commit changes text box
Commit changes
Select the edit pencil icon once again and make further edits
Commit changes once again
Select the 'History' button. This displays all the changes made above. Clicking on the 'commit hash' highlights that change on the original document in green. This hash can be seen in full in the url and at the top of the document header

Branching
From the 'Branch: master' dropdown enter the name of a new branch and then hit 'Create branch: *****'
The Branch will now refer to the new branch created, not 'master'
Edit the .txt file (in the new branch) and commit the changes directly to that branch

Compare & pull request
This option enables the changes that have been made in the alternative branch to be pulled back into the master, effectively making the alternative branch redundant. In other words take changes from the alternative branch and 'pull' them into master
To do this select 'Merge pull request' then 'Confirm merge'

Make changes on multiple branches (master and altervative branch 2)
